Wish to go is a plugin for travel bloggers that installs a Travel Bucket List manager and a Trip Planner for your readers

## Description

### A Plugin to Increase Visitor Engagement

Wish To Go Plugin implements a Travel BucketList that allows your readers to add destinations in the same way you add products in a wish list.

Every online store have a wish list. Why a travel blog shouldn't have one? Wish lists are an excellent tool to increase income:

Attract new traffic as you offer an added value to your readers.
Increase visitor engagement as they keep returning to check the wish list.
Identify reader's favourite destinations and suggest other related blog entries or products.

### Trip Planning Tool for Enhanced Reader's Experience

To complement the Wish List, the plugin implements a Trip Planner where your readers can plan their next trip based on the destinations stored in the wish list app.

Select destination from different countries.
Synchronize Flights and destination arriving and leaving dates.
Book and Record Hotel Bookings.
Add Tours and Activities to do at destination.
Sort destinations.
Automatically calculates hotel and travel booking dates.



### Relevant Advertisements to Boost Monetization

Don't bloat your site with non-related adverts, readers hate it. Use a clever advertisement approach to monetize your travel site. Show ads only when the traveller is ready to buy. The Trip Planner is where affiliate marketing rocks:

- Traveller can book lodging, trips and tours from the Trip Planner
- No cookie expiration worries. Your reader will purchase immediately from the Trip Planner.
- Don't bother your readers with spam. Target visitors only when the booking or products that you offer are relevant to them.
